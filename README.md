This report develops and optimizes 2T all-perovskite tandem solar cells for indoor white
LED harvesting. Single-junction perovskites show limits from the Jsc–Voc trade-off, 
thermalization, and transmission losses, motivating a shift to tandems. A 2.1 eV CsPbBr₃ 
top cell and 1.5–1.6 eV Rb₁MAFA bottom cell were selected for spectrum splitting and high 
photovoltage. 
SCAPS-1D simulations optimized bandgap, thickness, transport layers, and ICL behavior. The 
final tandem achieves ~41–42% efficiency, Voc ≈ 2.92 V, Jsc ≈ 33.6 mA/cm², and FF ≈ 80%, 
clearly outperforming single cells. These results show strong potential for powering indoor 
IoT and low-power systems.
